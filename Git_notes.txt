GIT AND GITHUB:
- Git is the version control software
- Github is the web service that uses Git 

REPO:
- This essentially keeps all the files
- Tick initialize the repo with README
- COMMIT → is equivalent to saving the file
- We can add notes to the commit so we can see what we changed 
- We can see the history of the file by pressing history 
- HASH → unique identifier for each commit

BRANCH:
- Each commit has a linear path and unique identifier
- The main branch is the MASTER branch
- However say we want to try a completely different idea for our file, we can create a NEW BRANCH
- Say we like the idea we have in our new branch, how can we move this new branch into our master branch?
- There is a button called Compare & Pull Request → we are making a request to merge those changes in our new branch into our master branch
- PULL REQUEST - this is a request to take some changes from a different branch and move it into another branch

FORKS AND PULL REQUESTS:
- Forking a repo is duplicating a whole repo and only it being only for you to edit, you will have a whole replica of the repo and you can make changes to it and it wont affect your “MAIN” repo.
- Say in our fork we really like one of the branches, we can move this branch into our MAIN repo by making a pull request 

CLONING:
- this is when you copy a repo from github onto your local pc/laptop so we can work on it offine, and we can PUSH this back onto git when we are done.
